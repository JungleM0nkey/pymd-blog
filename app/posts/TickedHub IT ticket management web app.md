This was a side project of mine that stemed from a simple idea of keeping IT tasks organized. It was also the project that got me into Flask as well as JS (specifically jQuery).
#
The code is not perfect, and there is a ton of stuff I would do differently now with a few other web apps under my belt, like add bootstrap support, replace global variables with session variables etc.

I think the sorting of the tickets in the front end was the most tedious part of this, bubble sorting is rough! I also want to give an honorable mention to sortable, the JS library is fantastic!

The original version of this app contains a couple more features like email inbox scraping aswell as .xlsx document parsing but I have not had time to look through them and intgrate them into this open source version.
